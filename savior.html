            i woke from a restless dream, a nightmare that lingered too long. i’m sorry for making you wait in the shadows of my silence, and thank you for waking me. i’m scared—there’s a yearning within me, a quiet ache to be needed, to be understood, to not feel alone. yet, as the world crumbles around us, all i want is to hold your hand amidst the chaos that drifts between us. because i believe in love—fragile as it may be—as the anchor that steadies us when everything seems ready to fall apart. but tell me, are you certain we can stand here, hand in hand? is there no fear within you that we might shatter like the others? still, i believe the world will find its balance as long as we are together. i believe in us; i truly do. i want to begin so many things with you, even if i stumble along the way. let me love you—imperfectly, but wholly—in my own way. keith, through everything we’ve endured together, i hope you can see that my love for you is the best gift i can offer. and i promise, i will keep loving you.
